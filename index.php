God knows they're squinters. Are you at all concerned about an uprising? She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen.</p>
                    <p>I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. NO TOUCHING!</p>
